# NMT House rental and purchase website

This is a webapp where users can see the available houses for a rent and purchase online, then they can rent or buy their favorite ones just by clicking a button.
This project is still on progress, i haven't finished it all.
The languages i am using are: html, css, javascript, bootstrap, Jquery, Express js, Node js & Mongodb.
